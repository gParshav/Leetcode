Only one that I found a bit challenging uptil now.

Firstly probably because my understanding of a BST was incorrect.

Everything that is to the left of a node has to be strictly lesser than the node. All the nodes and the children and absolutely everything.

And everything to the right of a node has to be greater than the node.

Also another things is that there are so many ways to make/reconstruct a BST. One can be really hard and one can be really easy. So if you start thinking about the difficult way, you will think thats the only way. But thats not true.

Always choose the easiest way. There always exists one and it is really easy.
