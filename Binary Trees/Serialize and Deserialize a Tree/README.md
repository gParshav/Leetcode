New things I got to know:

1. nullptr is a better alternative for NULL.
2. stringstream temp(<stringname>)
3. getLine(temp, str, <delimiter>)

str is nothing but a new empty string we have made, to keep whichever string we are iterating through.
Everytime you call getLine it gives you the next string after the delimiter and keeps on iterating by itself.
