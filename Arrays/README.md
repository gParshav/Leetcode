Random information on Arrays:
- If you simply initialize an array inside INT_MAIN, it will consist of random garbage values.
- If you initialize the same array outside INT_MAIN and in the global space it will consist of all zeroes by default.
- Maximum size of an array declared inside INT_MAIN is 10^6.
- Maximum size of an array declared globally is 10^7.


Basic Methods for all array problems:
1. For Loops
2. Hash Maps
3. 2 Pointer Approach
