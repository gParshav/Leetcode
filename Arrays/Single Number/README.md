Super easy.
Brute - You can use a map. Key having a value of 1 will be the answer.
Time Complexity - O(N)
Space Complexity - O(N)

Optimal - 
Just do XOR of all the elements. All those that occur twice will go to 0, and the one that remains is the one that doesn't occur twice and is your answer.

Time Complexity - O(N)
Space Complexity - O(1)
