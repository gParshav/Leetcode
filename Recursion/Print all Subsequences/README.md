One of the most important problems in recursion.

In the recursion function:-
For every element in the array, we explore two possibilities.
 - Take
 - Don't take
 
Finally we need to understand that every subsequence that we are interested in, goes through the limiting condition.
So we can put the print statement of whatever we want over there.
