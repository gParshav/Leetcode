We won't be involving DP right now.

Two ways to do this - 
1. Parameterized Recursion
2. Functional Recursion

I have a feeling that functional recursion may fail, when we have 0's in the array. No it won't actually.
It will work only because we are returning values only when i==n. At the end of the array.
