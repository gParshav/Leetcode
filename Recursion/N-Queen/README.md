This was solved by backtracking. I don't know what exactly that means.

We basically have to try all possibilities and then keep whatever matches our condition.(Probably thats what backtracking is)
Only thing is when you literally backtrack in the recursion tree, just reverse all the changes you made in that step, so that you can go to the next step properly.
