Couldn't understand the tabulation and space optimized solution for the method I was using.

Also a much better way to do this problem is to understand that its actually the same as partitions with given difference.
All positive elements are in s1, all negative are in s2.
s1+(-s2) = d, s1 - s2 = d.
Solving it in that way will be the easiest.
