Our mind is wired to think that if we are doing normal recursion or also memoization for that case, its ideal to start from the end and go to the start.

This way may not always be the best thing to do. It will work for sure always.

But it can really make some simple questions really difficult.

Questions which have a natural order to go from the start to the end.

In those kind of questions(this one too), its ideal to actually start from the start and go to the end.

Normally we do start from the end, but don't do that always.

Don't do that in these stock kind of questions.
