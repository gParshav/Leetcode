Why It Works: 
If there's no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the list before the slow pointer does, confirming there’s no loop. 

If there is a cycle, the fast pointer, moving faster, will always eventually catch up to the slow pointer due to the looping nature of the cycle. 

It’s like a faster runner on a circular track always catching up to a slower runner.
