Really good problem if you really think about it instead of simply memorizing the solution.

SO we need the middle of a linked list.

Basically if we have two pointers, we move the first one by 2x and the second one by 1x.
If the first one has reached the end, it is very natural that the second one has exactly reached the middle.

Just plain basic maths.
